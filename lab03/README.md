## Project description: lab03

This project is the second lab of the NLP1 course at EPITA. It is about the implementation of a Logistic Regression classifier using features extracted from a dataset of texts. The implementation uses PyTorch and compares the results with a baseline using scikit-learn. The default version is very slow using Pandas, but two optimized version are also available:
- using PySpark
- using numpy arrays

Answers to the lab are all detailled in the Pandas implementation, namely the two first default sections "Features" and "Logistic Regression". The optimized versions are only experimental and are not detailled, but the results are the same as the Pandas version.

## Submission

State: submitted on `2023-04-06`, ready for grading

LAB03 code is available in the `lab03.ipynb` notebook, as well as in pdf and html versions. It contains the answers to the questions and the code for the experiments, with comments and detailled procedure.
